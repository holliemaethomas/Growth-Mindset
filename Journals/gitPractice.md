# Learning Journal 1.3
## Reading and discussion
### topic: Git exercise and things learned. 

This exercise reminded me how important structure is when building out something like a learning journal. Even with a simple markdown, creating folders and using good naming conventions is important. 

My practice with git was a good reminder as well. I generally comment on what I did not why I did it. Better practices for learned techniques is always good!
