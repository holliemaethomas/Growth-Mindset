# The 5 W's,
#### and why they matter when it comes to process design

- Who

- What 

- When 

- Where

- Why (sometimes how)

The first step in process design is to consider your target audience **WHO**. Understanding Who the target audience is allows you to make style choice, UI choices like site flow, and language. 

Next comes **WHAT**. What information am I sharing with the customer, What should be the focus. For example is this informational only or instructional?

**WHEN** I actually dont have a good one for when but I have always known it as the 5 W's not the four. Let me know what you think. 

The **WHERE** factor helps to determine structure of the site. Where should I incorporate information or seperate out features. (Site planning)

Always end with **WHY**. Why are people coming to this site? Whether the purpose of the site is to purchase items, get information, or share something knowing WHY sets the prioritization. For example if I am selling you spoons the main focus on the home page shouldn't be about forks.
