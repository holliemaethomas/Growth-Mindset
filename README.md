### In the immortal words of Rocky Balboa "*it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.*" -Rocky IV

## Hello world!

My name is Hollie Thomas. I am a returning student to Codefellows.
I look forward to collaborating with all of you as we go through this course.  

 
 When I think of keeping a growth mindset I go back to the above quote. I can't tell you how many times I have taken a swing at life but I **CAN** tell you how many times I have gotten hit. "**ain't no body gonna hit harder than life**". At the barest of principals growth mindset is being resilient and persistant.  


 It can also be a struggle. In addition to watching Rocky I also try and remind myself of these three things:


- Growth can be painful *think back to childhood "growing pains"
- Growth doesn't happen over night
- Growth requires sacrifice


My [Github](https://github.com/holliemaethomas) is a good example of times I have used growth mindset. I have failed more times than I have succeeded. My failures are my building blocks to my succeeses.
