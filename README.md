### In the immortal words of Rocky Balboa "*it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.*" -Rocky IV

## Hello world!

My name is Hollie Thomas. I am a returning student to Codefellows.
I look forward to collaborating with all of you as we go through this course.  

 
 When I think of keeping a growth mindset I go back to the above quote. I can't tell you how many times I have taken a swing at life but I **CAN** tell you how many times I have gotten hit. "**ain't no body gonna hit harder than life**". At the barest of principals growth mindset is being resilient and persistant.  


 It can also be a struggle. In addition to watching Rocky I also try and remind myself of these three things:


- Growth can be painful *think back to childhood "growing pains"
- Growth doesn't happen over night
- Growth requires sacrifice


My [Github](https://github.com/holliemaethomas) is a good example of times I have used growth mindset. I have failed more times than I have succeeded. My failures are my building blocks to my succeeses.

 In this example I will show you something I recently learned. How to use a theme in your .MD files or sometimes called README. 
 To start I reccommend using [GitHub](https://github.com/).
 Initalize a repository with a README.md file included. Once the repository is built go to "Settings". Go to the section in settings called GitHub pages.

 Select "Choose Theme".
 
 Once you have selected your theme it is automatically added to your repository as a .yml file.
