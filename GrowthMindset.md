#### Growth Mindset and Beginnings.  
### In the immortal words of Rocky Balboa "*it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.*" -Rocky IV
 When I think of topics like being resiliant and keeping a growth mindset I go back to that quote. I can't tell you how many times I have taken a swing at life but I **CAN** tell you how many times I have gotten hit. "*ain't no body gonna hit harder than life**"
So, if you ask me and this assigment has, growth mindset is the ability to accept that life doesn't play fair and if you want to be succesful you have to be willing to take the hits. 

I remind myself to be resiliant by watching this [*video*](https://youtu.be/D_Vg4uyYwEk)
